Blocks
======

This is a port of my old Blocks game to Web via AI/Cursor.

----

This was one of the first games I ever wrote to completion. So I'm uploading the source just for the sake of nostalgia. :)

Blocks is a tetris like game written in Purebasic.

## Blocks features 3 modes:		
- <b>Baby Mode</b> - simple pieces constructed from 3 bricks.<br/>
- <b>Normal Mode</b> - standard tetris pieces.<br/>
- <b>Blocks Mode</b> - pieces constructed from 1 - 6 bricks. 28 different pieces, including a randomly generated piece that can take on bizzare shapes. In this mode it is possible to clear 6 lines at once, earning yourself a "Block." I recommend playing it in block mode and large size for the most fun. :) Enjoy!
High Scores are saved for each of the modes.<br/>

Compiled with PureBasic 3.94
